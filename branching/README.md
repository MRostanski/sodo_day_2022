# Summary

Branching is a strategy where **every environment/infrastructure variant is another branch** (development/stage/production, etc.)

* DON'T. Just don't.

If you really need to do it - JUST DO NOT!

If you would like some advantages:

* Difficult environments comparison makes code unreadable to hostile coworkers
* Cherrypicking is very good, just like with real cherries
* Wrong merge results can keep you up at night so more time to read
