# Summary

Using workspaces is a strategy of having every environment applied under a different workspace from the same code.

* Single set of variables
* FORCED consistency throughout environments
* Shared providers versions
* Makes development a bit more difficult if there is a period of inconsistency
* Never quite a real-life scenario
